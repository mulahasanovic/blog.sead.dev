### Hello World

That's how everything starts these days. Be it a textbook or a tutorial. I am pretty fond of it to tell you the truth. Since I am just an ordinary developer and not by any means a writer, I am scared how will my posts turn out. Frankly, I am not sure what to write about yet in this blog.
Perhaps share some notes?  Maybe share my attempts at new frameworks? We will see. Who knows? I sure don't.

I have a hunch the first few posts will be dim just like my programming sometimes. The situation is akin to when lights go out, and you tap around in the dark looking for the candles and the matches. You are thinking: What's so dim about this? Well, that might not be dim, but the problem is you don't have the candles nor the matches, so you end up waiting for the electricity to come back. Anyway, we will see how my blog work holds up in the long run.

### Blog tech
If you are interested, for this blog, I use a slightly edited [gatsby-starter-blog](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) template.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a free and open-source framework based on [React](https://reactjs.org/), which made this whole process easy.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) is everything you need to build a website. It is also keeping this blog alive and kicking.

I was compelled to mention them both since both are free. Now, if you wish to start your blog, nothing can stop you.
