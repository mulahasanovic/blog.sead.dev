description: TL;DR - From Bachelor's Degree in IT over C# to Web Dev.
---
I've got a Bachelor's Degree from the Faculty of Information Technology at the University "Džemal Bijedić" in Mostar.

Before that, I hardly knew what programming was, but I was adamant about enrolling there. It took me some time to switch from student mentality to one of the programmers. I had to learn how to describe the problems and find the needed solutions. Google helped. Once I got that nailed, it was time for me to move away from the university curriculum and start on my path.

My first stop was video game development with the Unity game engine. I encountered animating, modeling, and programming. Soon I realized I lacked direction. So I had to find it somehow.

I have found some sort of direction at the enlistee program at the local company. They organized practice together with businesses and universities with USAID "Partnership for education" backing. All enlisted participants were split into groups and given "real world" projects to work on to build up experience, hard and soft skills with the goal of learning and possible employment.

My group, consisting of eight members, was supposed to build a learning app. The goal was to help teachers and students including elementary, middle, and high school. To cut things short, the group soon fell apart. By the end of the month, we lost half of the group. The scope was big. Payday wasn't guaranteed. Those were the complaints, so I understood. There were better opportunities somewhere else and paying jobs. But I didn't want to quit yet. Four dropped to three, but we decided to move forward. The program finished with us having completed a demo prototype based on existing cms for learning apps. We were glad we pulled it through. The company that oversaw our group was interested in all three of us. We were in the talks of starting a start-up and being a separate company working for them, at least on one future project. I had my doubts. I knew I didn't like web programming in any shape or form. And basing my future on it was a sure way to lose interest and motivation, or so I feared. We were still students and inexperienced and no funds of our own. I was not sure I wanted to risk anything at this point.

So, as luck would have it, I got a job offer to work at the local game dev company. It didn't take too much thinking to call two other members and call the whole thing off. For the better or worse, we all split our way.

Next week I had my first job as the unity c# developer. The job was fun and hard. For the next week, we had ups and downs. It was fun and sad at times. Indy game dev is hard. It's the usual story, especially the struggles to keep the firm afloat. My time at this place needs an blog post of its own. It lasted a year, and I was already looking for my next job.

That brings us to my current job. A front-end developer, hehe.
