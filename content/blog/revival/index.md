description: Blog, work, and projects.

It has been almost a whole year since I wrote anything new here. Or was it two or three? What year is it?
The passage of time got weird with COVID around.  And with things getting back to normal a bit now, I have found myself thinking about this blog. Luckily the whole situation hasn't affected my work that much. Moving from office to home didn't change things for me, so it was business as usual.

Looking around over the web, some people spent their newly found extra time to improve some skills. And here I am, not even sure how I spent it all. All of it has merged in one giant blob. I know that during this time, I was busy enough with my regular work.

Thinking back about what I've done and learned made me want to quantify my work somehow. I've been with the current company since January of 2018, and during that time, I spent most of my time working on our Main app, new updates, new modules, new features, new integrations with this and that, the neverending progress. But between the updates and new modules, there was always something else.

I will not be naming names or linking links to the pages. So let's make a list, in no particular order of development:
- The Main app (the main one, app A in further text)
- The Landing page for the app A
- Slack integration for the A
- Documentation (think help) page for the A
- Documentation v2 page for the A (complete rework and design update)
- Mobile version for old company website (app B) with PWA
- Intermittent updates to the desktop version of B
- The Landing page for app C
- Payment systems for the C
- The app D, a mobile-only PWA/TWA (it can on desktop but not intended)
- And recently, page E, a completely new Tech Stack for me (C#, Orleans, EventStore, CQRS)

I am probably missing some smaller projects or one-off tasks. Also, I think it's important to mention, all pages and web apps except the last page E are custom designs without plugins or ready-made components.

Eventually, I might go into detail about specific troubles I had with each of these sites, but for now, let's keep it a secret :D
